# house-of-floors

Ok let me summarize my project idea better. I want to create an animated desktop background. The theme is an elevator lift that travels up and down and stops at different floors based on people traffic. People spend a random amount of time on each floor, they might do certain actions based on the floor they get off on, and then they queue to get back on the elevator. The elevator has a maximum capacity. People get off on random floors as well. The elevator side shifts up and down slightly depending on the direction itâ€™s going, but the floors are what really move upwards and downwards, you can only see 3 floors at a time on the screen. I want to be able to add floors easily. On start up the people should auto populate randomly on floors and a few in the elevator. There is one elevator operator always in the elevator. I want to stylistically draw out the elevator, floors, and people, probably on my iPad and upload their images. On the program I want to animate these images as per the functional logic I wrote. Give me an honest review of the idea and give me a plan to implement this project
